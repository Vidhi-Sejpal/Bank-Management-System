# Bank-Management-System

The Bank Management System is an application for maintaining a person's account in a bank. In this project I tried to show the working of a bank accounting system and cover the basic functionality of a Bank Management System by transfering money from one person to another using Flask and SQLAlchemy.The main objective behind this was to provide a efficient banking system for a customer and the staff of a particular bank.

# Features:
  * Transfer money through a database and HTML forms.
  * Check the balance list
