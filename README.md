# Bank-Management-System

The Bank Management System is an application for maintaining a person's account in a bank. In this project I tried to show the working of a bank accounting system and cover the basic functionality of a Bank Management System by transfering money from one person to another using Flask and SQLAlchemy.The main objective behind this was to provide a efficient banking system for a customer and the staff of a particular bank.

## Features:
  * Transfer money through a database and HTML forms.
  * Check the balance list 

## Steps for Using this System:
   * First you have to select a sender's name from the list
   * Add receiver name from the list to whom you want to transfer the money
   * Add your account number
   * Add the amount to be transferred
   * Click on the Transfer Money Button<br>
  An alert will be noftifed as <b>"Transfer Successfull!!"</b> once the money is credited
